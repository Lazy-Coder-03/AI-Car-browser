# Autonomous Car Simulation

This is a JavaScript-based autonomous car simulation inspired by a YouTube video [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI&t=982s).

The simulation features autonomous cars that navigate a road while avoiding obstacles. The cars are controlled by a neural network, and evolution strategies are used to train the cars to improve their performance over time.

## Features

- Multiple lanes and a road environment.
- Autonomous cars with neural network-based control.
- Evolutionary training to improve car performance.
- Traffic cars that the autonomous cars must avoid.
- Visual representation of the neural network used for car control.

## Setup and Usage

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You should see the simulation canvas.

3. You can interact with the simulation using the following keyboard controls:
   - Press 'S' to start or stop the simulation.
   - The simulation will automatically start after pressing 'S'.

4. Observe the autonomous cars as they navigate the road, avoid traffic, and evolve over time to improve their performance.

## Configuration

You can configure various aspects of the simulation by modifying the JavaScript code in the `sketch.js` file. You can adjust parameters such as the number of lanes, population size, traffic spawn probability, and more.

## Credits

- The base code for this simulation was inspired by a YouTube video, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI&t=982s).
